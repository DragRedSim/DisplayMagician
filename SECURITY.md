# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We support the latest version of DisplayMagician, and one version earlier than that.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report a vulneability by [logging an issue here](/issues) and mark it with a **vulnerability** label. Our development team will review it and we will determine whether it is a security vulnerability that we will fix. If we determine we will fix it, we will develop code to fix the vulnerability, and it will be subsequently released as part of a new version of software.

## Bug Bounty

DisplayMagician unfortunately does not operate a bug bounty program, and we are unable to pay out bug bounties for discovered vulnerabilities. We do, however, really appreciate any reports of security vulnerabilities, as we want to make our software safer and more robust.
